## Project 
For our DS4A empowerment, we decided to focus on the financial health of Americans. Specifically, we focused on financial wellbeing, which we defined as the ability to meet financial obligations while having the freedom to make financial choices. We wanted to see what effect does education have on an individuals financial wellbeing, and whether or not those effects differ between race.
What we found was that there was a positive connection between education and an individuals financial wellbeing, namely that those with higher education were more financially sound. However, our data wasn't clear as to whether those benefits were equal effective between different race groups.
